Chapter 9 INI parse
3/22/2015

use the given function from the book INIparser to parse out the given 
text from the book as well. run d8 on the iniParse.js and it should read the text you are going to parse with the parsed text right under that. i used stringify so it is a bit messy. i couldnt print out the objects any other way from what i found.
